# Ronan-s-Keyboard
I previously designed a macropad for blueprint. This was my Intro project to Hackpad and Hardware projects in general. Overall, this experience has been mind blowing and I thought that I would try to make a keyboard next.  You can veiw my macropad here: https://blueprint.hackclub.com/projects/9918
